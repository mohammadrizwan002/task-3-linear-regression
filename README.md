# Task 3 - Linear Regression (House Price Prediction)

What I Did:
In this project, I used linear regression to predict housing prices based on different features like area, bedrooms, location, etc.

 Dataset Used:
[House Price Prediction Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harishkumardatalab/housing-price-prediction)

Libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

Evaluation Metrics:
- MAE: (your value from output)
- MSE: (your value from output)
- RÂ² Score: (your value from output)

 Visuals:
- Heatmap to show correlation
- Actual vs Predicted Price Plot
- Coefficient values for each feature
